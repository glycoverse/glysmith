# glysmith 0.2.0

## New features

* Add `inquire_blueprint()` use a Large Language Model to generate a blueprint from user prompt.
* Add `step_tsne()` for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding.
* Add `step_umap()` for Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection.
* Add `step_roc()` for Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.
* `step_pca()` now also generates loading plot and screeplot, besides the individual plot.
* `step_pca()` (along with the newly added `step_tsne()` and `step_umap()`) now has an `on` parameter to control which experiment to perform the analysis on.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Update report content of `step_ident_overview()`. This is to adapt to the new `glyexp::summarize_experiment()` function introduced in `glyexp` 0.11.0.
* Update `blueprint_default()`: `step_ident_overview()` is now the first step, before `step_preprocess()`.
* Fix the bug that report content of DEA step for derived traits has "NA vs NA" contrast.
* Some plot names, table names, or step IDs have been changed to be more consistent.
* Update documentations of some step functions to better reflect their usage.
* `glysmith_result` now has a `data` field to store the data generated by the blueprint.
