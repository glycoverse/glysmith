# glysmith (development version)

# glysmith 0.3.1

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Fix deployment issue on r-universe.

# glysmith 0.3.0

## New features

* Added `step_quantify_motifs()` for quantifying glycan motifs. Updated relevant steps to support the `on` parameter for `motif_exp` experiments.
* `inquire_blueprint()` now prints an LLM-generated explanation to the console before returning the blueprint.
* `inquire_blueprint()` now supports an `exp` argument, accepting a `glyexp::experiment()` object, to provide more accurate, context-aware suggestions.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Refined step documentation to improve clarity and optimize `inquire_blueprint()` performance.
* Enhanced error messages for failed steps.
* Suppressed a harmless warning in `quench_result()` when used with `step_pca()`.
* Console messages from `step_pca()` now include the experiment name during `forge_analysis()`.
* Moved several dependencies (`pROC`, `Rtsne`, `uwot`, `EnhancedVolcano`, `org.Hs.eg.db`, `clusterProfiler`, `ggplotify`, `pheatmap`, and `factoextra`) to "Suggests". These are now automatically checked and installed when required by blueprint steps.

# glysmith 0.2.0

## New features

* Add `inquire_blueprint()` use a Large Language Model to generate a blueprint from user prompt.
* Add `step_tsne()` for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding.
* Add `step_umap()` for Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection.
* Add `step_roc()` for Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.
* `step_pca()` now also generates loading plot and screeplot, besides the individual plot.
* `step_pca()` (along with the newly added `step_tsne()` and `step_umap()`) now has an `on` parameter to control which experiment to perform the analysis on.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Update report content of `step_ident_overview()`. This is to adapt to the new `glyexp::summarize_experiment()` function introduced in `glyexp` 0.11.0.
* Update `blueprint_default()`: `step_ident_overview()` is now the first step, before `step_preprocess()`.
* Fix the bug that report content of DEA step for derived traits has "NA vs NA" contrast.
* Some plot names, table names, or step IDs have been changed to be more consistent.
* Update documentations of some step functions to better reflect their usage.
* `glysmith_result` now has a `data` field to store the data generated by the blueprint.

# glysmith 0.1.0

* First GitHub release.
