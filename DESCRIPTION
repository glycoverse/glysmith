Description: glysmith provides high-level, end-to-end workflows for glycomics 
    and glycoproteomics data analysis within the glycoverse ecosystem. 
    It acts as an orchestrator that integrates data cleaning, quality control, 
    derived trait computation, motif detection, statistical testing, and 
    visualization into unified, one-command analytical pipelines. 
    Built on top of the experiment() data container and domain-knowledge-aware 
    infrastructure provided by glyclean, glydet, glymotif, glystats, glyvis, 
    and related packages, glysmith enables users to quickly forge polished 
    tables, figures, and analysis reports suitable for publication. 
    The package is designed for reproducibility and ease of use, allowing both 
    novice and advanced users to obtain standardized and structure-aware results 
    with minimal code while retaining full flexibility for customization.
