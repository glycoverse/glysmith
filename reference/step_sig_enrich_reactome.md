# Step: Reactome Enrichment Analysis on Differentially Expressed Variables

Perform Reactome enrichment analysis on differentially expressed
variables using
[`glystats::gly_enrich_reactome()`](https://glycoverse.github.io/glystats/reference/gly_enrich_go.html).

This step requires `sig_exp` (filtered experiment from DEA). Run one of
[`step_dea_limma()`](https://glycoverse.github.io/glysmith/reference/step_dea_limma.md),
[`step_dea_ttest()`](https://glycoverse.github.io/glysmith/reference/step_dea_ttest.md),
or
[`step_dea_wilcox()`](https://glycoverse.github.io/glysmith/reference/step_dea_wilcox.md)
before this step. Only execute for glycoproteomics experiments with
exactly 2 groups. If used for glycomics experiments, the step will be
skipped. Use all genes in OrgDb as the background.

## Usage

``` r
step_sig_enrich_reactome(
  universe = "all",
  plot_type = "dotplot",
  plot_width = 7,
  plot_height = 7,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- universe:

  The universe (background) to use for enrichment analysis. One of "all"
  (all genes in OrgDb), "detected" (detected variables in `exp`).

- plot_type:

  Plot type for enrichment results ("dotplot", "barplot", etc.).

- plot_width:

  Width of the plot in inches. Default is 7.

- plot_height:

  Height of the plot in inches. Default is 7.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to
  [`glystats::gly_enrich_reactome()`](https://glycoverse.github.io/glystats/reference/gly_enrich_go.html).

## Value

A `glysmith_step` object.

## Details

Data required:

- `exp`: The experiment to perform Reactome enrichment analysis for

- `sig_exp`: The filtered experiment from DEA, generated by
  `step_dea_xxx()`.

Tables generated:

- `reactome_enrich`: A table containing the Reactome enrichment results.

only.*

- Include this step if needed.

- Leave `universe` to "all" (by default) unless the user explicitly
  mentions that the background should be the detected variables in
  `exp`.

- If the experiment has more than 2 groups but the user wants enrichment
  for a specific two-group comparison, ask which two groups to compare
  and include `step_subset_groups(groups = c("A", "B"))` before DEA and
  enrichment steps.
