# glysmith: Full-Featured Analysis Pipeline for Glycomics and Glycoproteomics

glysmith provides high-level, end-to-end workflows for glycomics and
glycoproteomics data analysis within the glycoverse ecosystem. It acts
as an orchestrator that integrates data cleaning, quality control,
derived trait computation, motif detection, statistical testing, and
visualization into unified, one-command analytical pipelines. Featuring
AI-assisted pipeline generation, glysmith can intelligently translate
natural language research questions into executable analysis blueprints,
streamlining complex bioinformatics workflows. Built on top of the
experiment() data container and domain-knowledge-aware infrastructure
provided by glyclean, glydet, glymotif, glystats, glyvis, and related
packages, glysmith enables users to quickly forge polished tables,
figures, and analysis reports suitable for publication. The package is
designed for reproducibility and ease of use, allowing both novice and
advanced users to obtain standardized and structure-aware results with
minimal code while retaining full flexibility for customization.
