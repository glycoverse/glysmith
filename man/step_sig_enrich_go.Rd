\title{Step: GO Enrichment Analysis on Differentially Expressed Variables}
\usage{
step_sig_enrich_go(universe = "all", plot_type = "dotplot", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{universe}{The universe (background) to use for enrichment analysis.
One of "all" (all genes in OrgDb), "detected" (detected variables in \code{exp}).}

\item{plot_type}{Plot type for enrichment results ("dotplot", "barplot", etc.).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[glystats:gly_enrich_go]{glystats::gly_enrich_go()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{glysmith_step} object.
}
\description{
Perform GO enrichment analysis on differentially expressed variables using \code{glystats::gly_enrich_go()}.
This step requires one of the DEA steps to be run.
Only execute for glycoproteomics experiments with exactly 2 groups.
If used for glycomics experiments, the step will be skipped.
Use all genes in OrgDb as the background.
}
\details{
Data required:
\itemize{
\item \code{exp}: The experiment to perform GO enrichment analysis for
\item \code{sig_exp}: The filtered experiment from DEA, generated by \code{step_dea_xxx()}.
}

Tables generated:
\itemize{
\item \code{go_enrich}: A table containing the GO enrichment results.
}
}
\section{AI Prompt}{

\emph{This section is for AI in \code{\link[=inquire_blueprint]{inquire_blueprint()}} only.}
\itemize{
\item Include this step if needed.
\item Leave \code{universe} to "all" (by default) unless the user explicitly mentions that
the background should be the detected variables in \code{exp}.
\item If the experiment has more than 2 groups but the user wants enrichment for a
specific two-group comparison, ask which two groups to compare and include
\code{step_subset_groups(groups = c("A", "B"))} before DEA and enrichment steps.
