\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

glysmith provides high-level, end-to-end workflows for glycomics and glycoproteomics data analysis within the glycoverse ecosystem. It acts as an orchestrator that integrates data cleaning, quality control, derived trait computation, motif detection, statistical testing, and visualization into unified, one-command analytical pipelines. Featuring AI-assisted pipeline generation, glysmith can intelligently translate natural language research questions into executable analysis blueprints, streamlining complex bioinformatics workflows. Built on top of the experiment() data container and domain-knowledge-aware infrastructure provided by glyclean, glydet, glymotif, glystats, glyvis, and related packages, glysmith enables users to quickly forge polished tables, figures, and analysis reports suitable for publication. The package is designed for reproducibility and ease of use, allowing both novice and advanced users to obtain standardized and structure-aware results with minimal code while retaining full flexibility for customization.
