\title{Step: Subset Groups}
\usage{
step_subset_groups(groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{groups}{Group names to keep. If \code{NULL}, this step will be skipped.}
}
\value{
A \code{glysmith_step} object.
}
\description{
Subset the experiment to specific groups using the \code{group} column in sample information.
This is useful when downstream steps require exactly two groups for comparison.
Usually run after \code{step_preprocess()} and before DEA or enrichment steps.
}
\details{
Data required:
\itemize{
\item \code{exp}: The experiment to subset
}

Data generated:
\itemize{
\item \code{full_exp}: The original experiment before subsetting
}

This step overwrites \code{exp} in the context with the subset experiment.

\itemize{
\item Use this step when the experiment has more than 2 groups but the user wants a specific two-group comparison.
\item Ask the user which two groups to compare, and place this step before DEA and enrichment steps.
\item Use the order of the user-provided groups to set factor levels.
