\description{
Preprocess the experiment using \code{glyclean::auto_clean()}.
This step can be omitted if the experiment is already preprocessed.

This step requires \code{exp} (experiment data).
}
\details{
Data required:
\itemize{
\item \code{exp}: The experiment to preprocess
}

Data generated:
\itemize{
\item \code{raw_exp}: The raw experiment (previous \code{exp}, saved for reference)
}

This step is special in that it silently overwrites the \code{exp} data with the preprocessed experiment.
This ensures that no matter if preprocessing is performed or not,
the "active" experiment is always under the key \code{exp}.
The previous \code{exp} is saved as \code{raw_exp} for reference.

\section{AI Prompt}{

\emph{This section is for AI in \code{\link[=inquire_blueprint]{inquire_blueprint()}} only.}
\itemize{
\item Always include this step by default unless the user explicitly excludes it
or tell you she/he has already performed preprocessing.
\item Ask for the column name for batch information if not provided.
\item Ask for QC samples in the experiment if not provided. If so, ask the group name of the QC samples.
Explain to the user that if it is "QC" for example, the samples with "QC" in the \code{group_col} column will be considered as QC samples.
And these QC samples will be used for choosing the best normalization and imputation methods.
Also mention that QC samples will be excluded after preprocessing.
\item If the user intents to perform biomarker related analysis, set \code{remove_preset} to "biomarker".
\item Use default values for other arguments unless the user explicitly specifies otherwise.
